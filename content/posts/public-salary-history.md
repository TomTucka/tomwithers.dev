I got inspired to do this a few weeks ago when [@Jamie Tanna](https://twitter.com/JamieTanna) posted a [blog post](https://www.jvt.me/posts/2021/09/09/public-salary-history/) on the subject. It's well worth going and reading Jamie's blog post; I resonate with all of what he says.

I think it's only fair to be transparent about my compensation. There are undoubtedly people who are underpaid for their work, and I hope that this will encourage more people to ask for the compensation they deserve.

You'll now be able to find my salary history on [/salary/](https://tomwithers.dev/salary/) page, and this Includes all my salaries from my first apprenticeship.
