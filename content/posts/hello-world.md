Hey Everyone ðŸ‘‹

I've decided to start writing blog posts about things I'm learning about or doing in my spare time. 

You'll most likely find me blogging about anything and everything DevOps related, Raspberry PI clusters and CI/CD. Some things might be useful, others will be notes for future Tom because let's face it, we never remember everything!  

You can find the [sources for my blog here](https://github.com/tomtucka/tomwithers.dev).
