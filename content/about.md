### Hey, I'm an engineer working remotly in South Staffordshire, UK, currently working as a Senior DevOps Engineer for the UK Government.

Outside of work I'm currently learning how to fly so I can obtain my Private Pilots License. I'm also organising [DevOpsDays Birmingham](https://twitter.com/devopsdaysbrum) and [CoffeeOps Birmingham](https://twitter.com/search?q=CoffeeOps%20Birmingham&src=typed_query)!
